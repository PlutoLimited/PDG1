## Ultra Flexible Tiny State Machine 


 1. A tiny **static library** `lib/libStateMachine.a`,
 2. **A command line binary `bin/statemachine`**, which links with the library,
 3. **An executable unit test** `bin/statemachine_tests`  using [Google Test library](https://github.com/google/googletest).
 4. **An optional BASH build script** `build-and-run` that you can use to quickly test if the project compiles, and runs.

```
#### Project Structure
